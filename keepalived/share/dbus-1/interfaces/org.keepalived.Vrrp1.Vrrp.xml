	  Signals VRRP process to print contents of vrrp_data

	  PrintStats:

	  Signals VRRP process to print stats in file

	  Creates new VRRP instance object at the path built
	  from the given parameters, implementing interface
	  org.keepalived.Vrrp1.Instance.
	  @iname must be unique to this object.
	  For every object created, there must also be an
	  actual VRRP instance, else all methods called on
	  this object will fail.

	  Deletes from the bus a VRRP instance object
	  identified by the iname value. If no such object

	  Only deletes the DBus object for the instance, to
	  successfully remove an instance it must also be
	  deleted from VRRP.
